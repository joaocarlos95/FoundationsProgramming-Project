### About
This course has two different projects, as described below:
  1. In the first project, we developed a program that verifies a credit card number, returning the corresponding financial services corporation and the category of the entity that issued that card. We also developed a program that generates credit card numbers given an abbreviation of a credit corporation.
  1. The second project was to develop the 2048 game.
